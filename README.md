⚡️This project focuses on implementing a C++ program that uses sorted linked lists to perform text analysis. 
⭐️The program processes a text document, extracts and normalizes words, and stores them in alphabetical order using a custom linked list class. 
✨It ensures that only unique words are stored, and the final output includes the count of unique words. Additionally, the project estimates the reading level of various public domain books by analyzing their vocabulary.
